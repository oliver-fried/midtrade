            <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
            <p>Basically, don't do anything that will get me in trouble for making this website, or in someway hurt others using this website. The stuff below should hopefully prevent me from getting fried.</p>
            <p>
            WELCOME TO MIDTRADE. We (Midtrade) hope you find it useful. By accessing or otherwise interacting with our servers, services, websites, mobile app ("App"), or any associated content/postings (together, "Midtrade"), 
            you agree to these Terms of Use ("TOU") (last updated February 19th, 2022). You acknowledge and agree Midtrade is a private site. If you are accessing or using Midtrade on behalf of a business, you 
            represent and warrant to Midtrade that you have authority to accept the TOU on behalf of that business and that that business agrees to the TOU. If you do not agree to the TOU, you are not authorized to use Midtrade or download the App. 
            We may modify the TOU at any time in our sole discretion. You are responsible for periodically checking for changes and are bound by them if you continue to use Midtrade. Our <a href="/prohibited">prohibited list 
            (midtrade.us/prohibited),</a> and all other policies, site rules, and agreements referenced below or on Midtrade, are fully incorporated into this TOU, and you agree to them as well.
            </p>

            <p>
            LICENSE. If you agree to the TOU and (1) are of sufficient age and capacity to use Midtrade and be bound by the TOU, or (2) use Midtrade on behalf of a business, thereby binding that business to the TOU, we grant you a limited, 
            revocable, non-exclusive, non-assignable license to use Midtrade in compliance with the TOU; unlicensed use is unauthorized. You agree not to display, "frame," make derivative works, distribute, license, or sell, content from Midtrade,
             excluding postings you create. You grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, unlimited, worldwide, fully paid/sublicensable license to use, copy, display, distribute, and make derivative works from content you post.
            </p>

            <p>USE. Unless licensed by us in a separate written or electronic agreement, you agree not to use or provide software (except our App and general purpose web browsers and email clients)
               or services that interact or interoperate with Midtrade, e.g. for downloading, uploading, creating/accessing/using an account, posting, flagging, emailing, searching, or mobile use.
                You agree not to copy/collect Midtrade content via robots, spiders, scripts, scrapers, crawlers, or any automated or manual equivalent (e.g., by hand). Misleading, unsolicited, 
                and/or unlawful postings/communications/accounts are prohibited, as is buying or selling accounts. You agree not to post content that is prohibited by any of Midtrade's policies 
                or rules referenced above ("Prohibited Content"). You agree not to abuse Midtrade's flagging or reporting processes. You agree not to collect Midtrade user information or interfere 
                with Midtrade. You agree we may moderate Midtrade access/use in our sole discretion, e.g., by blocking, filtering, re-categorizing, re-ranking, deleting, delaying, holding, omitting, 
                verifying, or terminating your access/license/account. You agree (1) not to bypass said moderation, (2) we are not liable for moderating or not moderating, and (3) nothing we say or do 
                waives our right to moderate, or not. Unless licensed by us in a separate written or electronic agreement, you agree not to (i) rent, lease, sell, publish, distribute, license, sublicense, 
                assign, transfer, or otherwise make available Midtrade or our application programming interface ("API"), (ii) copy, adapt, create derivative works of, decompile, reverse engineer, translate, 
                localize, port or modify the App, the API, any website code, or any software used to provide Midtrade, (iii) combine or integrate Midtrade or the API with any software, technology, services, 
                or materials not authorized by us, (iv) circumvent any functionality that controls access to or otherwise protects Midtrade or the API, or (v) remove or alter any copyright, trademark or other
                 proprietary rights notices. You agree not to use Midtrade or the API in any manner or for any purpose that infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates any intellectual property right or
                  other right of any person, or that violates any applicable law.</p>

                  <p>DISCLAIMER & LIABILITY. To the full extent permitted by law, Midtrade, and its officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, affiliates, and successors in interest ("Midtrade Entities") 
                    (1) make no promises, warranties, or representations as to Midtrade, including its completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, propriety, security or reliability; (2) provide Midtrade on an 
                    "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis and any risk of using Midtrade is assumed by you; (3) disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including as to accuracy, merchantability, fitness for 
                    a particular purpose, and non-infringement, and all warranties arising from course of dealing, usage, or trade practice; and (4) disclaim any liability or responsibility for acts, omissions, 
                    or conduct of you or any party in connection with Midtrade. Midtrade Entities are NOT liable for any direct, indirect, consequential, incidental, special, punitive, or other losses, including 
                    lost profits, revenues, data, goodwill, etc., arising from or related to Midtrade, and in no event shall such liability exceed $100 or the amount you paid us in the year preceding such loss.
                     Some jurisdictions restrict or alter these diclaimers and limits, so some may not apply to you.</p>

                     <p>CLAIMS & INDEMNITY. Any claim, cause of action, demand, or dispute arising from or related to Midtrade ("claims") will be governed by the internal laws of California, without regard to conflict of law
                        provisions, except to the extent governed by US federal law. Any claims will be exclusively resolved by courts in Baltimore, MD (except we may seek preliminary or injunctive relief anywhere). You agree
                         to (1) submit to the personal jurisdiction of courts in Baltimore, MD; (2) indemnify and hold Midtrade Entities harmless from any claims, losses, liability, or expenses (including attorneys' fees) that 
                         arise from a third party and relate to your use of Midtrade; and (3) be liable and responsible for any claims we may have against your officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, or any other party,
                          directly or indirectly, paid, directed or controlled by you, or acting for your benefit.</p>

                      <p>MISC. Unless you have entered into a separate written or electronic agreement with us that expressly references the TOU, this is the exclusive and entire agreement between us and you, and supersedes all prior
                         and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral. Users complying with prior written licenses may access Midtrade thereby until authorization is terminated. 
                         Our actions or silence toward you or anyone else does not waive, modify, or limit the TOU or our ability to enforce it. The USE, LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, and CLAIMS & INDEMNITY sections survive termination of the TOU,
                          and you will remain bound by those sections. If a TOU term is unenforceable, it shall be limited to the least extent possible and supplemented with a valid provision that best embodies the intent of the parties. 
                          The English version of the TOU controls over any translations. </p>
